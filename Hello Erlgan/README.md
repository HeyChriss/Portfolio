# Overview

This is my first attempt to use erlang functional programming language, and this was the first time tryint to learn a functional language. 
It was a great experience to learn this language and read along some tutorials to create a simple programin erlang. 

I love playing soccer and one of the things couches look for are qualities the players have. I created a program where ramdom
players can be added in ramdom teams and have a rank in how good they are and try to make it even for other teams. 
I was able to put the (ramdom) qualities and the name (which is also a number because I did use a built in library in the programm becaus eI do not have a database of names).
I also put the gender of the person and the total score amount for the team.

# Development Environment

To setup your development environment complete the following:

* Install Erlang You want to make sure that erl shell program is in the path.

* Visual Studio Code has support for Erlang. The Erlang extension can be installed in Visual Studio Code. The erl shell can be executed from the terminal.

Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. In this program I did not use any libraries with exception of BIF's in the program itself. (I did not use any databse for this program)

# Future Work

list of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.
* Better understanding of functions and syntax in erlang. 
* Look for better ways to understand erlang. There are many places to look for, but sometimes it is difficult to
understand the tutorials or to understand what is happening in the book. 
* I want to add a databse in the future to have better understanding of the program I just created.
