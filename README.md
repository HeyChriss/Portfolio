# Introduction 

Hi everyone. I am Christian and I am currently studying a major in Software Engineering at Brigham Young University Idaho. 

This is my second year in college and I have been working in projects from the school and personal projects in order 
to expand my knowledge in programming. This is a portfolio I have created with the purpose to show some of my code, some of the programs were created 
as a group and some of them were personal projects. 

About me: 
I am Christian and I am 23 years old. I was born in Guatemala and I am currently studying a major in Software Engineering at Brigham Young University Idaho. 
I love learning new things and ever since I was a kid I wanted to learn how computers and software worked. I was able to study programming when I turned 15 years old I 
did my first Hello World program. I am passionate in building projects and keep learning new programming languages. I have been working in some personal projects 
and I have been leading some other group projects with my friends. 

My dream is to work in a company where I could learn and help other people make their lives easier through software. Software has been part of my life since growing up
and I want to be part of building that community for others in the world.
