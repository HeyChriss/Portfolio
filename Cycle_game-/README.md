# Overview

This game is called cycles. The best rides are the ones where you bite off much more than you can chew, and live through it. Doug Bradbury -
Cycle is a game where the players try to cut each other off using cycles that leave a trail behind them.

Cycle is played according to the following rules.

Players can move up, down, left and right... Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys. Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys. Each player's trail grows as they move. Players try to maneuver so the opponent collides with their trail. If a player collides with their opponent's trail... A "game over" message is displayed in the middle of the screen. The cycles turn white. Players keep moving and turning but don't run into each other.

# Development Environment

* Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

 * python3 -m pip install raylib
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

* python3 main.py 
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

# Future Work

* In the future I want to have a menu for the game where the player can pick up the color. 
* Another thing I would like to work on in the future is to improve the background and work in a better 
way to create the cycles with better graphics and sound.
